abstract: "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic tool in various neurological and psychiatric conditions owing to its potential to modulate cortical excitability and induce neuroplasticity effects that outlast the stimulation period. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the motor cortex has been extensively investigated as a non-invasive treatment to improve motor symptoms in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Huntingtonâ€™s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, providing therapeutic efficacy. Recently, stimulation of the motor cortex has been employed for purposes beyond motor rehabilitation, including the treatment of, amongst others, headaches, sleep disorders and pain."
