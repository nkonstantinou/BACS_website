abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on all aspects of human life. Accurately measuring vaccine acceptance and understanding the factors that influence vaccine attitudes and behaviors is crucial to designing public-health interventions to reduce the impact of COVID-19 through vaccinations. The current study adapted the vaccine acceptance scale (Sarathchandra et al., 2018) to the Greek language and assessed the relationship between key components of vaccine acceptance to COVID-19 vaccine beliefs and attitudes, personal and family vaccination history and attitudes, and demographic variables (age, sex, education, and having children). The adapted vaccine acceptance instrument was found to have high internal consistency reliability. Further analyses indicated that younger and less-educated individuals are more vaccine-hesitant, and that vaccine acceptance is influenced by trust in authorities. These findings may have implications for understanding vaccine hesitancy and for the design and implementation of vaccine-related public health policies."
