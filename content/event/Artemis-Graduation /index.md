summary: Celebrating the Success of Artemis Traikapi
abstract: We are delighted to share the wonderful news of Artemis Traikapi's successful completion of her PhD. This marks a significant accomplishment in Artemis's academic career, and we are immensely proud of her achievements. Artemis's research in neurorehabilitation using brain stimulation has been pivotal in expanding our knowledge and offering hope of non-pharmaceutical neurorehabilitation approaches. Her dissertation, titled "Gamma-Band Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Rehabilitation of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease," has made profound contributions to the field, setting a benchmark for future research in the field. Throughout her tenure in our lab, Artemis has exemplified exceptional commitment, resilience, and intellectual rigor. Her innovative approach to research and her relentless pursuit of knowledge have not only contributed to her personal success but have also significantly enhanced our lab's academic culture. We have no doubt that Artemis will continue to make impactful contributions to her field and eagerly anticipate her future endeavors. As she embarks on the next phase of her career, we extend our warmest congratulations and best wishes.
