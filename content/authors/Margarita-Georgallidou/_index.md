Margarita Georgallidou holds a BA in Psychology from the University of Cyprus. Her passion for understanding the complexities of the human brain led her to pursue postgraduate studies in the Netherlands, where she earned a two-year Master's degree in Clinical Neurosciences from the Vrije University of Amsterdam. Margarita completed three internships during her academic journey, each contributing to her diverse skill set. She explored prefrontal cortex hemodynamic changes in healthy young adults using the FNIR system as part of her bachelor's degree internship at the University of Cyprus. In addition, she gained experience as a research assistant at a Centre for Applied Neuroscience in Cyprus, where she focused on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and attention modification training. For her postgraduate studies, Margarita worked at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre (UMC), where she conducted clinical and neuropathological research. Her master's thesis was on thalamic nuclei vulnerability in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using post-mortem data, allowing her to gain skills in neuroimaging, programming, diffusion imaging, tractography, histology, and brain segmentation. Her main research interests include clinical and cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging (MRI), brain stimulation (TMS), behavioural functioning, and neurodegeneration.
